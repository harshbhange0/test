                    Japanese domestic market </font>
            </b> (JDM) refers to Japan's home market for vehicles and vehicle parts. Japanese owners contend with a
            strict motor vehicle inspection and grey markets.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        The average age of JDM cars is 8.7 years, ranking 9th in a survey of 30 of the top 50 countries by gross
        domestic product. According to the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, a car in Japan travels a yearly
        average of over only 9,300 kilometers (5,800 miles), less than half the U.S. average of 19,200 kilometers
        (12,000 miles).</p>
    <P align="justify">
        Japanese domestic market vehicles may differ greatly from the cars that Japanese manufacturers build for export
        and vehicles derived from the same platforms built in other countries. The Japanese car owner looks more toward
        innovation than long-term ownership which forces Japanese carmakers to refine new technologies and designs first
        in domestic vehicles. For instance, the 2003 Honda Inspire featured the first application of Honda's Variable
        Cylinder Management. However, the 2003 Honda Accord V6, which was the same basic vehicle, primarily intended for
        the North American market, did not feature VCM, which had a poor reputation after Cadillac's attempt in the
        1980s with the V8-6-4 engine. VCM was successfully introduced to the Accord V6 in its redesign for 2008. </p>
    <p align="justify">
        In 1988, JDM cars were limited by voluntary self-restraints among manufacturers to 280 horsepower (PS) (276 hp)
        and a top speed of 180 km/h (111.8 mph), limits imposed by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA)
        for safety. The horsepower limit was lifted in 2004 but the speed limit of 180 km/h (111.8 mph) remains.</p>
    <p align="justify">
        Cars manufactured for the Japanese domestic market have been growing in popularity since the late 1990s.[5] Many
        car enthusiasts are attracted to JDM cars in different continents such as North America, Europe, Asia and
        Africa. Popular brands include Honda, Subaru, Toyota, Mazda, Suzuki, Lexus, Mitsubishi Motors and Nissan.</p>
    <p align="justify">
        Ex-Japan Imports are also very common in New Zealand where 59% of vehicles registered on New Zealand roads
        originated from overseas markets as opposed to 41% of which were delivered NZ-New. Of this, 94% originate from
        Japan. New Zealand imported an average of 134,834 JDM vehicles per year in the period 2015–2019, the majority of
        which were Mazda 3 (Axela), Suzuki Swift, Nissan Tiida, Toyota Corolla and Mazda 2 (Demio). Other models popular
        for importation in previous years include exotic vehicles (Honda Torneo, Nissan Skyline, Nissan Laurel and
        Toyota Altezza), and kei cars (Suzuki Carry, Daihatsu Move, Subaru R2). Due to the popularity of used imports
        from Japan, and their relatively poor crash-test ratings, the New Zealand Ministry of Transport is currently
        investigating tougher restrictions on imported vehicles, most notably on the importation of the Toyota Corolla,
        Mazda 2 (Demio) and Suzuki Swift.</p>
    <p align="justify">
        In 2004, importing JDM cars became popular in Canada as highly sought after vehicles, such as the 1989 Nissan
        Skyline GT-R, became eligible to import under Canada's 15-year rule. In contrast, importing grey market vehicles
        into the United States is much more difficult. To avoid regulatory problems, most private individuals wait until
        EPA restrictions no longer apply to the desired vehicle, which is done on a rolling 25-year cycle. <a

    <p>The Nissan Skyline GT-R is a sports car based on the Nissan Skyline range. The first cars named "Skyline GT-R"
        were produced between 1969 and 1972 under the model code KPGC10, and were successful in Japanese touring car
        racing events. This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code
        KPGC110, in 1973.</p>
    <p>After a 16-year hiatus, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 as the BNR32 ("R32") Skyline GT-R. Group A
        specification versions of the R32 GT-R were used to win the Japanese Touring Car Championship for four years in
        a row. The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship, with Jim Richards using it to
        win the championship in 1991 and Mark Skaife doing the same in 1992, until a regulation change excluded the GT-R
        in 1993. The technology and performance of the R32 GT-R prompted the Australian motoring publication Wheels to
        nickname the GT-R "Godzilla" in its July 1989 edition. Wheels then carried the name through all the generations
        of Skyline GT-Rs, most notably the R34 GT-R, which they nicknamed "Godzilla Returns", and described as "The best
        handling car we have ever driven". In tests conducted by automotive publications, R34 GT-R have covered a
        quarter of a mile (402 metres) in 12.2 seconds from a standing start time and accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62
        mph) in 4.4 seconds. It was one of the fastest accelerating production vehicles at the time.</p>
    <p>The Skyline GT-R became the flagship of Nissan performance, showcasing many advanced technologies including the
        ATTESA E-TS All-wheel drive system and the Super-HICAS four-wheel steering. Today, the car is popular for import
        drag racing, circuit track, time attack and events hosted by tuning magazines. Production of the Skyline GT-R
        ended in August 2002. The car was replaced by the GT-R (R35), an all-new vehicle based on a enhanced platform of
        the Skyline V36 platform. Although visibly different, the two vehicles share similar design features and are
        manufactured in the same factory.
        The Skyline GT-R was never manufactured outside Japan, and the sole export markets were Hong Kong, Singapore,
        Australia and New Zealand, in 1991, and the UK (in 1997, due to the Single Vehicle Approval scheme) as used
        Japanese imports.</p>
    <p>Despite this, the car has become an iconic sports car as a Grey import vehicle,in countries from the Western
        World (mainly the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, Canada, and the United States).
        It has become notable through pop culture such as The Fast and the Furious, Initial D, Shakotan Boogie, Wangan
        Midnight, Need for Speed, Forza, Driving Emotion Type-S, Test Drive, and Gran Turismo. In 2019, Nismo announced
        that it would resume production of spare parts for all generations of the Skyline GT-R, including body panels
        and engines. The car was named at the time by BBC's Top Gear as the only true Japanese contribution in the line
        of supercars, and by Jeremy Clarkson as one of the best cars in the world. <a

    <p>The Toyota Supra is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978.
        The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".</p>
    <p>The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced
        since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota
        Celica, but it was both longer and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the
        Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity
        and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and
        third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation
        was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the
        G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.</p>
    <p>The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations
        were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. Interior aspects were also similar,
        as was the chassis code "A". Along with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was
        derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when
        the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but
        without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval
        company logo. The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared on the first two
        generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica
        line until it was also discontinued.</p>
    <p>In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth generation of the Supra in the United States. Production of the fourth
        generation of the Supra for worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January 2019, the fifth generation of the Supra,
        which was co-developed with the G29 Z4, was introduced.</p>

    <p>Mazda RX-7 is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, rotary engine-powered sports car that was manufactured and
        marketed by Mazda from 1978 until 2002 across three generations, all of which made use of a compact, lightweight
        Wankel rotary engine.</p>
    <p>The first-generation RX-7, sometimes referred to as the SA (early) and FB (late), is a two-seater 2-door
        hatchback coupé. It featured a 12A carbureted rotary engine as well as the option for a 13B rotary engine with
        electronic fuel injection in later years.</p>
    <p>The second-generation RX-7, sometimes referred to as the FC, was offered as a 2-seater coupé with a 2+2 option
        available in some markets, as well as in a convertible bodystyle. This was powered by the 13B rotary engine,
        offered in naturally aspirated or turbocharged forms.</p>
    <p>The third-generation RX-7, sometimes referred to as the FD, was offered a 2+2-seater coupé with a limited run of
        a 2-seater option. It featured a sequentially-turbocharged 13B REW engine.
        More than 800,000 RX-7s were manufactured over its lifetime. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7"
